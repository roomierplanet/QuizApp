# QuizApp

QuizApp is a generic multiple-choice web application written in Vanilla Javascript 

This application fetches questions and their answers from the OpenTrivia DB API which change every time. 

User scores are stored as the game goes, and they have the option of storing their highscores onto local storage. If the user makes it to the top five, their username is
displayed on the high scores leaderboard in the game.

This simple application is a great way to practice Vanilla JavaScript. Any suggestions or feedback will be welcome on my e-mail at arnavnagpal@gmail.com
